Altered a model for the reviews to include the ID of the product it was written for and created a database migration for this change.
Add a dropdown on the page used for creating reviews to allow the user to pick the product
the review was written for by both the picture of the product and the name.
Modify said dropdown to store the ID of the product selected in the dropdown to the previously created ID section of the database housing the reviews.
